      <p>
        I’m Serhat Özdemir, a senior Computer Engineering student at Ankara
        Yıldırım Beyazıt University, passionate about building scalable and
        secure full-stack applications. With a strong foundation in both
        frontend and backend development, I strive to craft user-friendly and
        performance-oriented digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the frontend, I design responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, SCSS,
        Bootstrap, React, and Angular. On the backend, I develop robust RESTful
        services with C#/.NET, Node.js, and Express.js, while managing data with
        PostgreSQL and EF Core.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional experience includes developing a bank queue management
        system at SESTEK, contributing to the AdParcel project at CTSS with
        full-stack development, and building user-focused interfaces at Samsun
        Metropolitan Municipality. Additionally, I developed the BankNumerator
        Queue Management System, implementing .NET 9 Web API, JWT-based
        authentication, role-based authorization, and a modern Angular 20
        frontend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m dedicated to creating accessible, high-performance, and scalable
        applications, combining thoughtful design with solid engineering.
